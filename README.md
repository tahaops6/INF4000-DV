# INF4000 - Data Visualization 📊🎨

## Introduction 🔍

Stock price volatility, a critical measure of market risk, impacts investor decisions and market dynamics. This study explores the relationship between weekly stock price volatility and technical indicators like ATR, RSI, and MACD in the Health and Technology sectors. These sectors offer a contrast: Health is defensive and stable, while Technology is speculative and innovation-driven, enabling sector-specific insights. The research also evaluates predictive models’ effectiveness in identifying and forecasting drivers of volatility, addressing gaps in dynamic market predictions
